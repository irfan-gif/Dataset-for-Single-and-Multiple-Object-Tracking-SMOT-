Dataset: Combine Multiple MAVs Observation of Single and Multiple Moving Targets (CMOSMT)                  
Single UAV are not desirable for tracking multiple targets which have movements in different directions in the range of setup environment with miximum resolution. To increase field of view (FOV) as a result minimize the resolution power. In order to increase the resolution power, decreasing the field of view (FOV) as a result high probability to miss the target. For dynamic environment, challenge to track multiple targets with single UAV. To overcome the limitation using multiple robots having different field of view in process of shearing load. Cooperative team of robots are desirable for wide range applications such as surveillance and for monitoring. Based on cooperative UAVâ€™s teamwork, make dataset having different combination scenarios of objects. The scenarios are consisting movement of toys (Cars, Balls, Aeroplanes etc.).
